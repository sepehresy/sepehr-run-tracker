    Based on your selected activity, you demonstrated consistent pacing with notable heart rate control in the early kilometers. However, there's a gradual decline in pace and rise in HR after the halfway point, suggesting fatigue.

    **Suggestions:**
    - Focus on mid-run fueling strategies to avoid the dip in performance.
    - Incorporate tempo efforts to maintain form during late stages.
    - Consider reviewing cadence stability during climb segments.

    Overall, you're progressing well. Keep up the consistency and tune recovery before your next intensity block!
